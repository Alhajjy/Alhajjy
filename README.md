# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Alhajjy

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate software developer deeply committed to mastering programming fundamentals and strengthening logical problem-solving skills. I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code through disciplined engineering practices and modern software design principles.

My development approach emphasizes:

📌 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Leveraging encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to build well-structured, modular applications.

📌 **Scalable & Maintainable Architecture**: Designing systems that are easy to extend, debug, and evolve over time.

📌 **Deep Technical Understanding**: I don’t just use tools—I strive to understand how and why they work. This curiosity led me to study C++, where I explored low-level concepts that deepened my grasp of software internals and algorithmic thinking.

While my current focus is on desktop application development (primarily with C# and Windows Forms using a 3-tier architecture), I’ve also built foundational experience in web development and plan to expand my expertise in this area.

I’m continuously learning—not only new technologies, but also how to manage and decompose large-scale software systems with professionalism and precision.
